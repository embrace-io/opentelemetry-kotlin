# examples

Contains example apps that demonstrate how to use opentelemetry-kotlin on different platforms.
Generally speaking each app will execute shared code in `example-common` to demonstrate the Kotlin
API.
Additional instructions are available in README files of individual apps.

Currently these example apps just use a simple exporter that prints to console/stdout. In future
these apps will be updated to showcase the API to a greater extent.
